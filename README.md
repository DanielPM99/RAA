# What is this?

This is a Python code of an automatic respirator.

# Requirements

For running each sample code:

- Python 3.9.x

- numpy

- math

- time

- sim imported by the files in the repository sim.py and simConst.py

# Documentation

This README only shows how to execute the final simulation.

If you are interested in simulating the other examples they are incompleted so you might have to correct some errors in order to simulate them.

All the 3D files and images are stored in https://github.com/DanielPM99/RAA/tree/main/3D_Models

The tinkercad images for the potentiometer and the oximeter are stored in https://github.com/DanielPM99/RAA/tree/main/Tinkercad_Models
